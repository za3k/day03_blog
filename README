Hack-A-Day is a project I'm doing in November, where I try to make 30 new projects, in 30 days.

Day 03: Hack-A-Blog.

This is a multi-user blog. Anyone can register and post to the blog. Registration is done by logging in with a username that's never been used before.

This was the simplest CRUD application I could think of. I wanted to get the basics (serving web pages, databases, login) etc done in one project. That way, tomorrow I can do something more complex, and copy what I have today.

Feel free to use it for anything!
